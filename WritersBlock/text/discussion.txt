Hey, I prefer to be called Brendan. You pronounce that like you'd probably pronounce brenden, brendun and maybe even brendn. I am from Bellingham, Washington. I'm a junior. My majors will be CS and CAMS soon. I'm working on creating tools in java which generate text or audio that mimics source material.
